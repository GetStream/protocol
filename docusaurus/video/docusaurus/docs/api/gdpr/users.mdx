## Users export

:::note

_This endpoint requires a server-side authentication._

:::

Stream allows you to export users with their data, including the calls they participated in.  
The operation is performed asynchronously, so calling this endpoint will return a task ID that you can use to [monitor the execution of the export](../../misc/async).  

Once the task is completed, the result of the `GetTask` endpoint call will contain a URL to the file.

<Tabs groupId="examples">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
// export users
let resp = await client.exportUsers([userid1,userid2]);
// resp.task_id is the ID to be used for monitoring the task

// when the export is done and the task is completed, an URL is returned to have access to the file
resp = await client.get_task(resp.task_id)
console.log(resp)
// output:
{
  "task_id": "123",
  "status": "completed",
  "result": {
    "url": https://link/to/file.json'
  }
}
```
