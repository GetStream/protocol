## Deleting a call

You can either soft-delete or hard-delete a call and all its related data (members, sessions, recordings, transcriptions).

When hard-deleting a call, it is marked as deleted synchronously and then will be completely wiped from our system and its related data asynchronously.
An ID is returned which allows you to follow the status of the async task.

<Tabs groupId="examples">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
// soft-delete a call
const resp = await call.delete({
  hard: false,
});
// resp.call contains call information

// hard-delete a call
const resp = await call.delete({
  hard: true,
});
// resp.taskID is the ID to be used for following task status
```
