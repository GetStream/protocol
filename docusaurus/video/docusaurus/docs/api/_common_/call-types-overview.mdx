Call types provide sensible default settings for different use-cases. We provide the following types out of the box:

- **Default** (`default`) for 1:1 or group calls that use both video and audio
- **Livestreaming** (`livestream`) to build ultra low latency livestreaming for your app on our global edge network. Broadcast from your phone or RTMP and scale to millions of participants.
- **Audio room** (`audio_room`) to build audio experiences for your app. You can build basic calling or feature rich experience like Twitter spaces. Audio quality, reliability and scalability is far ahead of competing solutions.
- **Development** (`development`) This call type comes with almost all permission settings disabled so that it is simpler to get your initial implementation up and running. You should only use this call type early-on during development.

Each of our [SDKs have tutorials specific for each call type](https://getstream.io/video/sdk/). If you want to know the default settings for each of the call types check out the [Built-in call types page](/api/call_types/builtin).

It's possible  to tweak the built-in call types or create new ones.
