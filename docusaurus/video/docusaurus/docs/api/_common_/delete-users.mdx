Deleting a user means:

- the user can't connect to Stream API
- their data won't appear in user queries

Delete has the following opitions:

| Name                   | Type                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Optional |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `user`                 | Enum (soft, pruning, hard) | - Soft: marks user as deleted and retains all user data. <br /> - Pruning: marks user as deleted and nullifies user information. <br /> - Hard: deletes user completely - this requires hard option for messages and conversation as well.                                                                    | Yes      |
| `conversations`        | Enum (soft, hard)          | - Soft: marks all conversation channels as deleted (same effect as Delete Channels with 'hard' option disabled). <br /> - Hard: deletes channel and all its data completely including messages (same effect as Delete Channels with 'hard' option enabled).                                                   | Yes      |
| `messages`             | Enum (soft, pruning, hard) | - Soft: marks all user messages as deleted without removing any related message data. <br /> - Pruning: marks all user messages as deleted, nullifies message information and removes some message data such as reactions and flags. <br /> - Hard: deletes messages completely with all related information. | Yes      |
| `new_channel_owner_id` | string                     | Channels owned by hard-deleted users will be transferred to this userID. If you doesn't provide a value, the channel owner will have a system generated ID like `delete-user-8219f6578a7395g`                                                                                                                 | Yes      |
| `calls`                | Enum (soft, hard)          | - Soft: marks calls and related data as deleted. <br /> - Hard: deletes calls and related data completely <br /> Note that this applies only to 1:1 calls, not group calls                                                                                                                                    | Yes      |
