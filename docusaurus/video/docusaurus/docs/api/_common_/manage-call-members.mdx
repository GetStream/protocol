You can provide a list of call members, this can be done when you create a call or later on when the call already exists. Please note that call members need to be existing users.

There are two reasons to use call members:

- Call membership allows you to have more flexibility when it comes to permissions. The permission system allows you to grant different permissions to users and members, this way one user can be a member on one call or a member on another.
Membership also allows you to grant additional roles to users in a call. It's important to note that this doesn't restrict access, but rather expands capabilities.
You can more information about the roles and permissions [here](/api/call_types/permissions/).
- Call members will receive [push notifications](/api/call_types/settings/#push-notifications-settings).

```py
call.update_call_members(remove_members=["sara"])
```

response, err := call.UpdateCallMembers(ctx, &getstream.UpdateCallMembersRequest{
    RemoveMembers: []string{
        "sara",
    },
})
```
