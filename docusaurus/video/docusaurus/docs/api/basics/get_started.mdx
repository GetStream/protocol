Stream powers [Chat Messaging](https://getstream.io/chat/), [Video & Audio](https://getstream.io/video/), and [Activity Feeds](https://getstream.io/activity-feeds/) for billions of global end-users across thousands of different apps.

Streamâ€™s global edge network ensures a faster and more reliable experience for your video calls and livestreams. Excellent developer experience and docs enable you to build in-app video calling in days. Scale to millions of users and thousands of call participants.

For the average Stream integration, the development work focuses on code that executes in the client. However, some tasks must be executed from the server for safety (for example, token generation).

Stream provides server-side SDKs to help execute these tasks.

You can reference our [development roadmap](https://github.com/GetStream/protocol/discussions/177) to know which languages and features are supported.

## Installation

All official SDKs are available on package managers, full source code is available on the GetStream Github organization.

<Tabs groupId="examples">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```bash
npm install @stream-io/node-sdk
// or using yarn
yarn add @stream-io/node-sdk
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="py" label="Python">

```bash
pip install getstream
```

Something doesn't work? You can open a GitHub issue:

- [Python SDK](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-py)
- [Node SDK](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-node)

## Creating client

To create a server-side client, you'll need your **API key** and **secret**. Both of them can be found in your [Stream Dashboard](https://dashboard.getstream.io/).

You can optionally pass a timeout for the API requests, the default timeout is 3000ms.

<Tabs groupId="examples">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
import { StreamClient } from '@stream-io/node-sdk';
// or
// const { StreamClient } = require("@stream-io/node-sdk");

const apiKey = '';
const secret = '';
client = new StreamClient(apiKey, secret);

// optionally add timeout to API requests
// the default timeout is 3000ms
client = new StreamClient(apiKey, secret, { timeout: 3000 });
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="py" label="Python">

```py
from getstream import Stream

client = Stream(api_key="your_api_key", api_secret="your_api_secret", timeout=3.0)
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Creating users and user tokens

To create a user you need to provide an ID, and their role. Optionally you can also specify their name and an image, these fields are recognized and rendered by the default SDK components. It's also possible to add any other custom data.

Tokens need to be generated server-side. Typically, you integrate this into the part of your codebase where you log in or register users. The tokens provide a way to authenticate a user or give access to a specific set of video/audio calls.

<Tabs groupId="examples">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
const userId = 'john';
const newUser: UserObjectRequest = {
  id: userId,
  role: 'user',
  custom: {
    color: 'red',
  },
  name: 'John',
  image: 'link/to/profile/image',
};
await client.upsertUsers({
  users: {
    [newUser.id]: newUser,
  },
});

// exp is optional (by default the token is valid for an hour)
const exp = Math.round(new Date().getTime() / 1000) + 60 * 60;

client.createToken(userId, exp);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="py" label="Python">

```py
from getstream.models import UserRequest

# ensure the user exists
client.upsert_users(
    UserRequest(
        id="tommaso-id", name="tommaso", role="admin", custom={"country": "NL"}
    ),
)


# the token will be valid for 1 hour
client.create_token(user_id="tommaso-id", expiration=3600)
```
