## Creating users

Stream Users require only an ID to be created. Users can be created with the role of user or admin. The role will be set to user if a value is not provided in the request. There are additional properties you can provide to further describe your users.

The `name` and `image` fields are special fields that are supported by client-side SDKs.

You can provide additional data for the user object using the `custom` field.

<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
const newUser: UserObjectRequest = {
  id: 'userid',
  role: 'user',
  custom: {
    color: 'red',
  },
  name: 'This is a test user',
  image: 'link/to/profile/image',
};
await client.upsertUsers({
  users: {
    [newUser.id]: newUser,
  },
});
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="py" label="Python">

```py
users = {}
user = UserRequest(
id='user_id', role="user", custom={"color": "red"}, name="This is a test user",image= "link/to/profile/image",
)
users[user.id] = user
client.upsert_users(users=users)
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Updating users

There are two ways to update user objects:

- Updating will replace the existing user object
- Partial update will let you choose which fields you want to change/unset

<Tabs groupId="examples">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
const user: UserObjectRequest = {
  id: 'userid',
  role: 'user',
  custom: {
    color: 'red',
  },
  name: 'This is a test user',
  image: 'link/to/profile/image',
};
client.upsertUsers({
  users: {
    [user.id]: user,
  },
});

// or
client.updateUsersPartial({
  users: [
    {
      id: user.id,
      set: {
        color: 'blue',
      },
      unset: ['name'],
    },
  ],
});
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="py" label="Python">

```py
users = {}
user = UserRequest(
  id= 'userid',
  role= 'user',
  custom= {
    "color": 'red',
  },
  name= 'This is a test user',
  image= 'link/to/profile/image',
)

users[user.id] = user
client.upsert_users(users=users)

// or
client.update_users_partial(
  users= [
    {
      id: user.id,
      set: {
        color: 'blue',
      },
      unset: ['name'],
    },
  ],
)
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Anonymous users

Anonymous users are users that are not authenticated. It's common to use this for watching a livestream or similar where you aren't authenticated. Anonymous users can be connected using client-side SDKs. Anonymous users are not counted toward your MAU.

## Guest users

Guest users are temporary user accounts. You can use it to temporarily give someone a name and image when joining a call. Guest users can be created client-side. Guest users are counted towards your MAU usage.

## Deactivating and deleting users

While it is usually safer for data retention to deactivate a user, some use cases require completely deleting a user and their data.

Deactivating a user means:

- the user can't connect to Stream API
- their data will be retained
- a deactivated user can be reactivated

Deleting a user means:

- the user can't connect to Stream API
- their data won't appear in user queries

Delete has the following opitions:

- Mark messages deleted: delete all the messages the user sent
- Delete conversation channels: delete all 1:1 channels with the deleted user
- Hard delete: by default the user and its data is soft deleted, and the user can be restored. If this flag is set to `true`, all user data is removed, and the user can't be restored.
- New channel owner ID: channels owned by hard-deleted users will be transferred to this userID

//restore
client.restore_users( user_ids= ['<id>'] )
```

## User tokens

Stream uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to authenticate chat users, enabling them to log in. Knowing whether a user is authorized to perform certain actions is managed separately via a role-based permissions system. Tokens need to be generated server-side.

You can optionally provide an expiration time. By default, tokens are valid for 1 hour.

<Tabs groupId="examples">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
const userId = 'john';
// exp is optional (by default the token is valid for an hour)
const exp = Math.round(new Date().getTime() / 1000) + 60 * 60;
client.createToken(userId, exp);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="py" label="Python">

```py
import time

# user ID
user_id = 'john'

# exp and iat are optional
# the token will be valid for 1 hour
exp = int(time.time()) + 60 * 60

client.create_token(user_id = user_id, expiration = exp)
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Call tokens

Call tokens contain a list of call IDs. If a user is authenticated with a call token, they can only access the specified calls. They are helpful if you want to limit call access, but you want to avoid managing call members (an example: a pay-pre-view link for livestreams, with hundreds of thousands of expected viewers).

<Tabs groupId="examples">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
const userId = 'john';
// exp is optional (by default the token is valid for an hour)
const exp = Math.round(new Date().getTime() / 1000) + 60 * 60;

const call_cids = ['default:call1', 'livestream:call2'];

client.createCallToken(userId, call_cids, exp);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="py" label="Python">

```py
import time

user_id = 'john'

# exp and iat are optional, token will be valid for 1 hour
exp = int(time.time()) + 60 * 60

call_cids = ['default:call1', 'livestream:call2']

client.create_cal_token(user_id=user_id, expiration=exp,call_cids= call_cids)
```
