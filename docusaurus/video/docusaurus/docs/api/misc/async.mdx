Certain operations, such as deleting a call or deleting a user, require additional time and processing power. As a result, these operations are executed asynchronously.

### Monitoring tasks

You can monitor these tasks using the `GetTask` endpoint. Calling this endpoint will provide information such as:
- `status`: Current status of the task (see statuses below for more details)
- `result`: Result of the task, depending on the nature of the task
- `error`: If the task failed, this will contain information about the failure

### Task Statuses

The task can have the following statuses:
- `pending`: Task is pending and not running yet
- `running`: Task is running and not completed yet
- `completed`: Task is completed and successfully executed
- `failed`: Task failed during its execution

### Example

Asynchronous operations will return an ID, which you can use to monitor the task. Here's an example:
<Tabs groupId="examples">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
// hard-delete a callm which will be executed asynchronously
let resp;
resp = await call.delete({hard: true})

// resp contains the task ID
resp = await client.get_task(resp.task_id)
console.log(resp)
// output:
{
  "task_id": "123",
  "status": "running",
  "error": null, // will be present only if there is an error
  "result": {} // will be present only if the task returns a result
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
