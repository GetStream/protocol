import AsyncTasks from '../_common_/async-tasks.mdx';

Certain operations, such as deleting a call or deleting a user, require additional time and processing power. As a result, these operations are executed asynchronously.

These tasks will return a `task_id` in the API response, you can use this id to monitor the task status.

### Monitoring tasks

You can monitor these tasks using the `GetTask` endpoint. Calling this endpoint will provide information such as:

- `status`: Current status of the task (see statuses below for more details)
- `result`: Result of the task, depending on the nature of the task
- `error`: If the task failed, this will contain information about the failure

### Task Statuses

The task can have the following statuses:

- `pending`: Task is pending and not running yet
- `running`: Task is running and not completed yet
- `completed`: Task is completed and successfully executed
- `failed`: Task failed during its execution

### Example

Asynchronous operations will return an ID, which you can use to monitor the task. Here's an example:

<AsyncTasks />
