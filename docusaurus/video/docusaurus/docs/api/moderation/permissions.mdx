Stream has a role-based permission system. Each user has an application level role, and also channel (chat product) and call (video product) level roles.

Every role (be it application or call/channel level) contains a list of capabilities. A capability is an action (for example create call). The list of capabilities assigned to a role defines what a user is allowed to do.

This page focuses on call-level roles.

## Video capabilities

The list of [video capabilities](../../call_types/builtin/#default-call-capabilities) are available on the Call Types page.

## Call roles

Every user that has access to a call has a call-level role assigned to them. Users can have different roles for different calls (for example a user can be a host in one call, and a viewer in another).

### Built-in roles

Call roles are defined on the call type level. Every [built-in call type](../../call_types/builtin/) comes with a default set of roles set up to match their use-case (a livestreaming app requeires different roles than an audio room). You can customize these roles, for a code example see the [call types settings page](../../call_types/permissions).

It's also possible to customize the roles in your [Stream Dashboard](https://dashboard.getstream.io/).

### Custom roles

It's also possible to define your own custom roles to extend the built-in call types, or when [creating your own call types](../../call_types/manage). For a code example see the [call types settings page](../../call_types/permissions).

You can also create your own roles in your [Stream Dashboard](https://dashboard.getstream.io/).
