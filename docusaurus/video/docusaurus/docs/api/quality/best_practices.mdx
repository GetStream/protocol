### Noise cancellation

Noise cancellation greatly improves the quality of audio, the same applies to transcriptions and closed-caption. It is highly recommended to have noise cancellation enabled by default for all calls.

### Integrate error reporting in your application

It is very important to track errors, Stream does not

### Integrate user rating at end of calls

This is very valuable and makes it easier to understand if there are any issues with the user experience.

### Show connection issues indicator

SDKs expose this information, make sure to show a clear message when a user is having issues.

### Avoid re-rendering, overlays and other expensive rendering processing

- if you render video elements too often (eg. bind views to something that changes a lot)
- use of heavy video filters can be detrimental
- if your app adds some visual overlays
- resizing video element often
- show too many video tracks

### Pick the right target resolution

Our SDKs and Dynascale technology ensures that the right resolution is used. If your application does not need very high resolution, it is still a good practice to set the maximum resolution to 1080p

### Handle errors and messages when selecting devices

Selecting a device (mic, speaker, camera) is an async operation that can error. Your UI should handle this correctly with loading states and error messages.

### Muted mic indicators

It is very common for users to not select the right mic, your application UI should make this clear and easy to understand.
Link to cookbook for this.

### Speaker indicators and messages

Show incoming audio levels so that users don't think your app is broken. SDK exposes this, check the cookbook

- chrome might be muted (SDK should have a message for that)
- maybe your speaker is off or you use the wrong one, ...

### Keep SDK up-to-date

Newer SDKs come with quality improvements and bug-fixes. It is highly recommended to keep your app updated with our latest SDK versions.

### Permissions settings

- If your app handles groups, you might want to configure permissions so that only some users are allowed to speak
- Implement moderation endpoints into your app so you can remote mute users

### Prompt browser problems to user

- Chrome requires a restart due to pending update ...
- SDK is unable to list devices ...

### Handle unsupported platforms clearly

Very old browsers are not supported well, it is best to explain clearly to the user to pick the correct browser or to update to a recent version.
SDKs expose this information directly, you can hook up your application to SDK helpers so that you do not have to directly check the version.
