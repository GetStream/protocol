### Video quality introduction

1. CPU/GPU
2. Networking
3. Device issues

### Stream Edge infrastructure

Stream video utilizes its own edge network of video servers to ensure the best network connectivity. Users automatically connect to the nearest edge which guarantees a low-latency connection.
Latency, reliability and bandwidth are fundamental to the user experience. The closer users are to the server, the lower the latency and the less likely it is for packets to be lost and require a retransmission.

### Dynascale

Stream video utilizes Dynascale, a technology built in-house, to ensure that each participant in a call send and receive video efficiently and at the best quality that their device can handle.

- Users will only receive video tracks that are rendered on their screen
- Users will send video based on the resolution that other users need
- Video resolution sent and received is adjusted to avoid congesting the internet connection
- Smooth video at high fps is preferred over higher resolution video with poor framerate, when video framerate degrades, SDK will automatically lower the resolution

Dynascale comes included to all Stream Video SDKs and guarantees efficient video at the best quality available by users' devices.

### Video Codecs

Codecs are fundamental to video quality, Stream video picks the best codec based on the devices in the call. Ideally, all calls would always run on codecs such as VP9 and AV1.
In reality this is not always possible because codec support is very fragmented and not all device/browser can encode/decode efficiently all codecs.

For this reason, Stream Video will sometimes use codecs such as VP8 or H.264 instead of VP9 or AV1. Doing so will ensure that all participants in the call are able to see each other and send/receive video at the best quality.

### Explain stats

We collect audio/video statistics directly from SDKs (fps, jitter, bandwidth/cpu problems, ...) and use this information on the dashboard.
