import Storage from '../_common_/storage.mdx';

By default, call recordings are stored in an AWS S3 bucket managed by Stream, located in the same region as your application.
Recording files are retained for two weeks before being automatically deleted.
If you need to keep recordings longer or prefer not to store this data with Stream, you can opt to use your own storage solution.

## Uploading times

Call recordings are uploaded immediately under the following conditions:

- The call has ended.
- Call recording is manually stopped.
- The call recording exceeds 2 hours in duration.

For lengthy calls, multiple files will be uploaded. Each file will contain up to 2 hours of video.

Upload times vary based on the storage method used. Below is a table providing a conservative estimation of upload times:

|           | <=5 minutes | <=1 hour | <=2 hours |
|-----------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| Audio     | < 10s       | < 10s    | < 10s     |
| HD Video  | < 10s       | < 30s    | < 60s     |
| FHD Video | < 10s       | < 60s    | < 120s    |

Please refer to this table to estimate the upload times based on your specific storage setup.
