By default, call recordings are stored in an AWS S3 bucket managed by Stream, located in the same region as your application.
Recording files are retained for two weeks before being automatically deleted.
If you need to keep recordings longer or prefer not to store this data with Stream, you can opt to use your own storage solution.
