## Introduction

This page shows how you can create or update roles for a call type.

Stream has a role-based permission system. Each user has an application level role, and also channel (chat product) and call (video product) level roles. Every role (be it application or call/channel level) contains a list of capabilities. A capability is an action (for example create call). The list of capabilities assigned to a role defines what a user is allowed to do. Call roles are defined on the call type level.

## Configuring roles

When you create a call type you can specify your role configurations. A role configuration consists of a role name and the list of capabilities that are enabled for that role.

When you create a call type it comes with a default set of configuration. You can override or extend that.

The following example overrides the capabilities of the built-in `admin` role, and defines the `customrole`.

Please note that for the below code to work you need to create the `customrole` beforehand, you can do that in your [Stream Dashboard](https://dashboard.getstream.io/).

<Tabs groupId="examples">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
client.video.createCallType({
  name: '<call type name>',
  grants: {
    admin: [
      VideoOwnCapability.SEND_AUDIO,
      VideoOwnCapability.SEND_VIDEO,
      VideoOwnCapability.MUTE_USERS,
    ],
    ['customrole']: [
      VideoOwnCapability.SEND_AUDIO,
      VideoOwnCapability.SEND_VIDEO,
    ],
  },
});

// or edit a built-in call type
client.video.updateCallType('default', {
  grants: {
    /* ... */
  },
});
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Built-in roles

There are 5 pre-defined call roles, these are:

- `user`
- `moderator`
- `host`
- `admin`
- `call-member`

You can access the default roles and their capabilities in your [Stream Dashboard](https://dashboard.getstream.io/).
