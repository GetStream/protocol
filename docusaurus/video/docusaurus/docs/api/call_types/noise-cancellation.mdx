Noise cancellation is a feature that removes background noise from a call. This feature is useful when you are in a noisy environment and want to improve the call quality.
Stream video SDKs come with built-in noise cancellation, which you can enable or disable as needed.

Note: noise cancellation is performed on the device that captures the audio and not by Stream servers.

The built-in noise cancellation is optimized for voice calls and is not suitable for capturing music or other audio. You can configure noise cancellation for your call types in three ways:

- `available` noise cancellation can be enabled by users via SDK but it starts disabled
- `disabled` noise cancellation is not available for users to enable (do this if you want to ensure noise cancellation is never used)
- `auto-on` noise cancellation is always enabled for all calls, users can still disabled it manually via SDK

### Best practices

1. Use noise cancellation to improve call quality, especially in noisy environments
2. Do not use noise cancellation if you want to capture music or other audio
3. Noise cancellation is charged per minute, if you dont need it, disable it to save costs

### Custom noise cancellation

All SDKs come with support for custom audio and video filters. If needed, you can bring your own noise cancellation filter instead of using the built-in noise cancellation. SDK docs have more information on how to do this.
