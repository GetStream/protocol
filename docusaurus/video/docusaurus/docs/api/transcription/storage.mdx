import Storage from '../_common_/storage.mdx';

By default, transcriptions are stored in an AWS S3 bucket managed by Stream, located in the same region as your application.
Transcription files are retained for two weeks before being automatically deleted.
If you need to keep transcriptions longer or prefer not to store this data with Stream, you can opt to use your own storage solution.
