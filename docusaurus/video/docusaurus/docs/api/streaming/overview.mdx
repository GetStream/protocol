In this section we are going to explain how you can use Stream to power different livestream use-cases.

Stream video allows you to power ultra low-latency streaming (hundreds of milliseconds). This is made possible by our worldwide edge infrastructure which support WebRTC for consuming and sending video.

Other important features related to livestream that are discussed in this section:

- Multiple streams & co-hosts
- RTMP in and WebRTC input
- Exporting to HLS
- Recording

## Quickstart

Before diving into the detail, let's get a livestream up and running.

### Create a new livestream call using the API

<Tabs groupId="examples">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```javascript
call = client.video.call('livestream', callId);
const response = await call.getOrCreate({
  data: {
    created_by_id: 'john',
    members: [{ user_id: 'john', role: 'host' }],
  },
});
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="py" label="Python">

```py
def hello_word():
    print("Hello world")
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

By default livestreams are created in backstage mode, when in backstage mode streams can only be accessed by admin-like users.
This is necessary because it makes it possible to create the setup in advance and to notify and grant access to viewers when the event starts.

All we need to do in this case is call the `GoLive` method on the call object and that will make it accessible to viewers.

<GoLive />

### Create a simple test app using the livestream video player

TODO: point to a simple webapp where you can run our video player, OK to use something like Codesanbox

### Test sending video using WebRTC

You can refer to this [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/livestream-tutorial-mlqtrd?file=/src/App.tsx) - where you can send videos via WebRTC

### Test sending video via RTMP using OBS

Let's keep the demo app open and try to send video to the same call using RTMP.

#### Log the URL & Stream Key

​

<RTMP />

#### Open OBS and go to settings -> stream

​
Select "custom" service
Server: equal to the rtmpURL from the log
Stream key: equal to the streamKey from the log

Press start streaming in OBS. The RTMP stream will now show up in your call just like a regular video participant.

Now that we've learned to publish using WebRTC or RTMP let's talk about watching the livestream.

### Set the call live

Until now we connected to the call as the host user. By default livestream calls are configured to only allow hosts to send audio/video tracks.
Viewers on the other hand are not
