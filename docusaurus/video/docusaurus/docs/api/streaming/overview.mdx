In this section we are going to explain how you can use Stream to power different livestream use-cases.

Stream video allows you to power ultra low-latency streaming (hundreds of milliseconds). This is made possible by our worldwide edge infrastructure which support WebRTC for consuming and sending video.

Other important features related to livestream that are discussed in this section:

- Multiple streams & co-hosts
- RTMP in and WebRTC input
- Exporting to HLS
- Recording

## Quickstart

Before diving into the detail, let's get a livestream up and running.

### Create a new livestream call using the API

```
// TODO: show how to create a livestream call
// TODO: create a user and make it the host of the call (add it as a member)
```

By default livestreams are created in backstage mode, when in backstage mode streams can only be accessed by admin-like users.
This is necessary because it makes it possible to create the setup in advance and to notify and grant access to viewers when the event starts.

All we need to do in this case is call the `GoLive` method on the call object and that will make it accessible to viewers.

```
// TODO: call.goLive() here
```

### Create a simple test app using the livestream video player

TODO: point to a simple webapp where you can run our video player, OK to use something like Codesanbox

### Test sending video using WebRTC

TODO: point to a simple webapp where you can send video via webrtc (Codesanbox?)

### Test sending video via RTMP using OBS

Let's keep the demo app open and try to send video to the same call using RTMP.

TODO: show the code and instructions to send video via OBS

### Set the call live

Until now we connected to the call as the host user. By default livestream calls are configured to only allow hosts to send audio/video tracks.
Viewers on the other hand are not
