[WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) allows you to have low-latency streaming (hundreds of milliseconds).

To set up WebRTC-based streaming, your viewers must join the call. Once they join the call, they can access the video and audio streams that are published in the call.

## Users

You can use regular, guest or anonymous users to join the livestream. It's also possible to create call tokens that only allow access for specific calls. For more information, see the [authentication page](../../authentication).

## Permissions

The built-in `livestream` call type comes with sensible default permissions. However, if you create your own call type, you should make sure that the role you assign to viewers has the proper configuration (for example it restricts sending audio/video).
