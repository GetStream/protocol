[WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) allows you to have low-latency streaming (hundreds of milliseconds).

## Start and stop WebRTC broadcast

The WebRTC broadcast is always on. Viewers can access it by joining the call. You can control who can join the call with [backstage mode](../../streaming/backstage).

## Consuming WebRTC broadcast

Your viewers must join the call to access the stream. You can use regular, guest or anonymous users to join the livestream. It's also possible to create call tokens that only allow access for specific calls. For more information, see the [authentication page](../../authentication).
