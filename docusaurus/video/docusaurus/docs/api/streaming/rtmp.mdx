## RTMP input service overview

RTMP input is a service designed to bridge the gap between RTMP (Real-Time Messaging Protocol) and WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication). 
It enables users to stream content using an RTMP client, such as OBS (Open Broadcaster Software), and have that content published to participants in a [Call](../basics/calls.mdx). 
The service will transcode the received media to ensure compatibility with WebRTC. It will also publish multiple qualities of it with [Simulcast](https://getstream.io/resources/projects/webrtc/architectures/simulcast/).

_Please note that this page is about publishing video/audio using RTMP, **NOT** watching livestreams using RTMP._

### About RTMP

[RTMP](https://rtmp.veriskope.com/docs/spec/) is a real-time streaming protocol created by Adobe, as media container format it uses Flash Video [FLV](https://rtmp.veriskope.com/pdf/video_file_format_spec_v10.pdf)
also developed by Adobe.

There's also an enhanced RTMP protocol, created to support a [wider range of newer video codecs](https://veovera.org/docs/enhanced/enhanced-rtmp-v2)
like AV1, HEVC and VP8. OBS for example supports AV1 and HEVC. **RTMP input service doesnâ€™t support them**.

## RTMP publishing

This is how you can acquire the necessary information for publishing RTMP using a third-party software.

<RTMP />

The user(s) streaming from the third-party software will show up as regular users in the call.

You can see an example in the [Quickstart](../../streaming/overview/#test-sending-video-via-rtmp-using-obs).

### Streaming into a call with OBS

1. Open OBS and go to `Settings` (CMD + , on macOS).
2. Set the `Stream Type` to `Custom`.
3. Set the `URL` to the `rtmp_url` you got from the API.
4. Set the `Stream Key` to the `stream_key` you got from the API.

#### Optimal OBS Video Encoding Settings

To ensure optimal quality and performance when transcoding media from RTMP, follow these recommended H.264 encoding settings:

Go to `Settings`:

**Video**:
- Base Resolution: 1920x1080
- Output Resolution: 1920x1080 (Same as input resolution)

**Output**:
- Encoder: `x264`
- Rate Control: `CBR` (Constant Bit Rate)
- Bitrate: 3,000-6,000 kbps (adjust based on your network and type of media being streamed, higher movement will require higher bitrate)
- Keyframe Interval: 2 seconds
- CPU Usage Preset: `veryfast` (balance between quality and encoding speed)
- Tune: `zerolatency`

_The example is for OBS, but any other RTMP client should support adding the same settings_

### Streaming into a call with restream.io

1. Go to [restream.io](https://restream.io/) and create an account.
2. For streaming to a custom RTMP server, you need to have a paid account.
3. Add a new channel and select `Custom RTMP`.
4. Set the `Server` to the `rtmp_url` you got from the API.
5. Set the `Stream Key` to the `stream_key` you got from the API.

### Streaming a file into a call with FFmpeg

With your call's RTMP url `$CALL_RTMP_URL` and your token streamKey `$STREAM_KEY` from [publishing](#rtmp-publishing). 
Run:

```bash
ffmpeg -re -stream_loop 400 -i YourVideoFile1080p30fps.mp4 \
  -c:v libx264 -preset veryfast -tune zerolatency \
  -pix_fmt yuv420p -g 50 -c:a aac -b:a 160k \
  -ac 2 -f flv "$CALL_RTMP_URL/$STREAM_KEY"
```

### FAQ

#### What is the typical latency introduced by RTMP?

RTMP input typically introduces a latency of 2-5 seconds. This can vary based on the network conditions, encoder settings (as the stream will be transcoded), and the performance of the RTMP server. 
Optimizing [encoding settings](#optimal-obs-video-encoding-settings) and ensuring a stable network connection can help minimize this latency.

####  What are the best practices for setting up OBS for RTMP streaming?

Refer to [Optimal OBS Video Encoding Settings](#optimal-obs-video-encoding-settings).

#### Do we support both RTMP and RTMPS?

No, our service supports exclusively RTMPS. RTMPS is the recommended for secure streaming as it uses SSL/TLS to encrypt the data, providing an additional layer of security over RTMP.

#### What are the recommended internet connection settings for optimal streaming performance?

- **Upload Speed**: At least double the target bitrate of your stream. For example, if streaming at 5,000 kbps, ensure an upload speed of at least 10 Mbps.
- **Connection Type**: Wired Ethernet connection is preferred over Wi-Fi for stability.
- **Network Quality**: Ensure low packet loss (<1%) and low jitter (<30ms).
