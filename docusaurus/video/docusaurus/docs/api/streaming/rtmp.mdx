## RTMP input support overview

Almost all livestream software and hardware supports RTMP. Our API supports using third-party software for streaming using RTMP.

_Please not that this page is about publishing video/audio using RTMP, **NOT** watching livestreams using RTMP._

## RTMP publishing

This is how you can acquire the necessary information for publishing RTMP using a third-party software.

<RTMP />

The user(s) streaming from the third-party software will show up as regular users in the call.

You can see an example in the [Quickstart](../../streaming/overview/#test-sending-video-via-rtmp-using-obs).

### Streaming into a call with OBS

1. Open OBS and go to `Settings` (CMD + , on macOS).
2. Set the `Stream Type` to `Custom`.
3. Set the `URL` to the `rtmp_url` you got from the API.
4. Set the `Stream Key` to the `stream_key` you got from the API.
