[HLS streaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming) provides better buffering than WebRTC, at the cost having a slight delay in your livestreams.

## Start and stop HLS broadcast

There are two ways to start/stop HLS broadcast:

<Broadcast />

Or, if you're using backstage mode, you can do that when going live:

<GoLive />

Once the live ended, the HLS broadcast will be stopped as well.

## User permissions

To perform these operations, users need the following capabilities:

- `start-broadcast-call`
- `stop-broadcast-call`

## Broadcast state

You can check if the call is being broadcasted like this:

<Tabs groupId="examples">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
const resp = await call.getOrCreate();
const isBroadcasting = resp.call.egress.broadcasting;
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="py" label="Python">

```py
resp = call.get()
isBroadcasting = resp.data().call.egress.broadcasting
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Events

These events are sent to users connected to the call and your webhook/SQS:

- `call.broadcasting_started`
- `call.broadcasting_stopped`
- `call.broadcasting_failed`

## Consuming HLS broadcast

Users don't need to join the call to consume the HLS broadcast, but they need to have the URL of the broadcast:

<Tabs groupId="examples">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
const resp = await call.getOrCreate();
const URL = resp.call.egress.hls?.playlist_url;
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="py" label="Python">

```py
resp = call.get()
URL = resp.data().call.egress.hls.playlist_url
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
