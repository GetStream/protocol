You can have events shipped to an AWS SNS topic or to an AWS SQS queue if you want. Same as webhook, this can be configured directly from the Dashboard.

## Authentication

There are 2 ways to configure authentication for SQS and SNS:

1. Grant Stream's AWS account permission to use your SQS/SNS resources. (recommended)
2. Provide your AWS key and secret in the Stream Dashboard.

### Role based policy example (SQS)

If you decide to use the first approach, you need to attach a policy to your SQS like this one:

```json
{
  "Sid": "AllowStreamProdAccount",
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Principal": {
    "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::185583345998:root"
  },
  "Action": "SQS:SendMessage",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:sqs:us-west-2:1111111111:customer-sqs-for-stream"
}
```

### Role based policy example (SNS)

If you decide to use the first approach, you need to attach a policy to your SQS like this one:

```json
{
  "Sid": "AllowStreamProdAccount",
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Principal": {
    "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::185583345998:root"
  },
  "Action": "SNS:Publish",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:1111111111:customer-sns-topic"
}
```

### SQS Best Practices

- Set the maximum message size set to 256 KB
- Set up a dead-letter queue for your main queue
- Setup alerts in case the size of the queue is growing too fast
