Stream can send payloads of all events from your application to an Amazon SQS queue you own.

An application with a lot of users generates a lots of events. With a standard Webhook configuration, events are posted to your server and can overwhelm unprepared servers during high-use periods. While the server is out, it will not be able to receive Webhooks and will fail to process them.
One way to avoid this issue is to use Stream Chat's support for sending webhooks to Amazon SQS.

SQS removes the chance of losing data for Chat events by providing a large, scalable bucket that holds events generated by Steam in a queue for your server or other .

## Configuration

You can configure your SQS queue through the Stream Dashboard or programmatically using the REST API. Stream needs the right permissions on your SQS queue to be able to send events to it. If updates are not showing up in your queue add the following permission policy to the queue:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Sid": "Stmt1459523779000",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
          "sqs:GetQueueUrl",
          "sqs:SendMessage",
         "sqs:SendMessageBatch",
         "sqs:GetQueueAttributes"
       ],
       "Resource": [
         "arn:aws:sqs:region:acc_id:queue_name"
       ]
     }
   ]
}
```
