        JWT should be always provided when stream-auth-type=jwt.

        Using JWT auth request could be authenticated as user or as server-side.

        When using user authentication permission checking is going to be applied to requests based on the user that is
        performing a request.

        The `authorization` header should be a JWT string signed using the secret attached to the API key used to perform
        requests.

        **WARNING** all client-side official SDK do not ship with token generation; this is to make sure that the API secret is not
        shared with an untrusted party such as a browser or a iOS/Android application. Tokens **must** be generated server-side.
        If you wish, you can configure your application to ignore authentication (see `disable_auth_check`)
        The JWT string must include only the user_id claim and can include any built-in JWT claim such as iat, exp as well.

        Stream-Auth-Type should be always set in order to authenticate the request. Possible
        values: `jwt` or `anonymous`.

        `jwt` allows you to authenticate as a user. With this auth type you should also provide valid JWT in Authorization
        header.

        `anonymous` allows you to authenticate as anonymous user. Please note that most advanced features are not available
        to anonymous users.
