Stream offers the ability to import data for both the **[Chat](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/javascript/import/)** and **[Feeds](https://getstream.io/activity-feeds/docs/javascript/importing_data_feeds/)** products.

To simplify data generation and ensure it conforms to the expected format, we provide **JSON Schema** files that can be used to validate the data before import.

There are many **[JSON Schema validators](https://json-schema.org/tools?query=&sortBy=name&sortOrder=ascending&groupBy=toolingTypes&licenses=&languages=&drafts=&toolingTypes=&environments=&showObsolete=false&supportsBowtie=false#validator)** available for different programming languages that you can use to validate your data.

For more information, please refer to the **[JSON Schema documentation](https://json-schema.org/docs)**.
